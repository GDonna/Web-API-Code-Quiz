# Web-API-Code-Quiz
Homework #4 (NU Bootcamp 2023)

This is my submission to the Web API Code Quiz Challenge.


## User Story
```
AS A coding boot camp student
I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers
```

## Acceptance Criteria
```
GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and score
```

## Notes
This has been a more challanging code to build from scratch. I had the most problem with the display of the score and name entry format, as well as the timer setting.
